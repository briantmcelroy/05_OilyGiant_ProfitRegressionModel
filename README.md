# 05_OilyGiant_ProfitRegressionModel

## About this Project

In this project we analyzed hypothetical drilling data for the oil drilling company OilyGiant. 100,000 survey points each at 3 different sites were taken, and OilyGiant plans to drill at 200 points in one of the three sites. Our goal is to train a regression model that can analyze features taken from a survey point and predict a numeric value of the oil reserve. 

The project demonstrates how simple linear regression modeling is sufficient for numeric, qualitative targets, and how 95% confidence bootstrapping for profit is an ideal measure of model success.

## Running it Yourself

The Jupyter notebook is self-contained and reflects the outputs of the code contained within. If you would like to connect to your own environment and run the notebook, or make changes on your own fork of the repo, you may do so after cloning. Make sure the environment is either based in the upper-level folder to which you clone the repo, or be sure to replace the dataset file references with a direct local reference to the /datasets/ folder on your machine. 

The project uses scikit-learn 1.5.1 and is stable with Python 3.11.
